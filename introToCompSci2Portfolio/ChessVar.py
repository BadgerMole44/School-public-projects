# Description: This file contains the ChessVar class and its supporting classes ChessBoard, ChessPiece and chess pieces
#   subclasses. Together these classes simulate a variation of a game of chess where the game ends when a king is
#   captured. There is no check or checkmate, and there is no castling, en passant, or pawn promotion. There are two
#   fairy pieces that can be utilized.
#       Falcon: moves forward like a bishop, and backward like a rook
#       Hunter: moves forward like a rook and backward like a bishop
#   fairy pieces can enter the board once a player loses their queen, a rook, a bishop, or a knight, they may, on any
#   subsequent move. The fairy pieces enter the board on an empty square of their two home ranks.
#   Doing so constitutes a turn. The player becomes eligible to enter their remaining fairy piece (falcon or hunter)
#   after losing a second piece (queen, rook, bishop, or knight)(could be anytime after losing the first piece, donâ€™t
#   need to be losing after entering the first fairy piece).
